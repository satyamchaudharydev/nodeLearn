# nodeLearn
This is documentation or tutorial for node. Whatever things I am learning, I am making documents of that. I’ll try to make this documentation “Zero to Hero” from scratch. I am a noobie programmer, I know nothing about networks, servers, HTTP and all the other backend related stuff. But I want to learn so that I can feed my inner Soul. I really want to learn about networks and servers, and this is completely new for me. So I have to learn so many times. This I why I am documenting this so that I can come and see where I am stuck. This is a document version of my learning from the internet, including videos and articles.
